# Master-Thesis
This repository is linked to the master's thesis : How close an NLP model can be to a numerical data input machine learning model ?
The goal of this thesis is to quantify the loss of accuracy when switching from structured to unstructured data for a wine variety prediction task. This repository is then composed of all codes used in our analysis. There is a first foler concerning our dataset creation and a second one concerning the analysis of our datasets as well as the implementation of our models.
